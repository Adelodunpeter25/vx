# Split Panels Phase 0 Decisions

- Status bar: global single bar
- Search/replace scope: per-pane
- Markdown preview: per-pane
- Buffer model: allow shared buffers across panes

Notes
- Active pane owns input focus and cursor display.
- Global status bar will show active pane mode and its messages.
